# Analysis 

"According to a 2020 data retrieved from Northeastern University, the median weekly earnings of someone with a Bachelor's degree
working in the United States is $1,248 with an annual earnings of $64,896." 
"Retrieve from: https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/average-salary-by-education-level/" 

"With this in mind, I will make $64,896 as a benchmark. Colleges with a median annual earning of $64,896 or higher 
as high-earning colleges and below $64,896 as low-earning colleges." 

#Filter college for bachelor's degree and removing NA values. 
bachelors_degree_trend <- clean_data %>% filter(preddeg == 3, na.rm=TRUE) 

#Creating dummy variables with ifelse() function to set the benchmark, where '1' is high-earning and '0' is low-earning. 
bachelors_degree_trend$medianEarning <- ifelse(bachelors_degree_trend$md_earn_wne_p10-reported-earnings >= 64896, '1', '0') 

colnames(bachelors_degree_trend) 

#Selecting only columns that we want to use in our data set. 

bachelors_degree_trend <- bachelors_degree_trend %>% select(unitid, opeid, instnm, city, preddeg, sat_avg, 
                       ugds, md_earn_wne_p10-reported-earnings, medianEarning, index_std)

# Regression 
"We are interested on whether there is an impact on Google Trends index on median earnings as well as sat_avg (SAT average score)."
