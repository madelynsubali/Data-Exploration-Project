# Analysis 

"According to a 2020 data retrieved from Northeastern University, the median weekly earnings of someone with a Bachelor's degree
working in the United States is $1,248 with an annual earnings of $64,896." 
"Retrieve from: https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/average-salary-by-education-level/" 

"With this in mind, I will make $64,896 as a benchmark. Colleges with a median annual earning of $64,896 or higher 
as high-earning colleges and below $64,896 as low-earning colleges." 

#Filter college for bachelor's degree and removing NA values. 
clean_data <- read_csv('clean_data.csv')
bachelors_degree_trend <- clean_data %>% filter(preddeg == 3, na.rm=TRUE) 

#Creating dummy variables with ifelse() function to set the benchmark, where '1' is high-earning and '0' is low-earning. 
bachelors_degree_trend$medianEarning <- ifelse(bachelors_degree_trend$`md_earn_wne_p10-reported-earnings` >= 64896, '1', '0') 


#Selecting only columns that we want to use in our data set. 

bachelors_degree_trend <- bachelors_degree_trend %>% 
                          dplyr::select(unitid, opeid.x, instnm, city, monthorweek, preddeg, sat_avg, 
                                        ugds, `md_earn_wne_p10-reported-earnings`, medianEarning, index_id) %>%
                          mutate(date= as.Date(str_sub(monthorweek, 1,10))) %>%
                          group_by(month = floor_date(date, "month"), medianEarning) %>%
                          summarize(index_id = mean(index_id, na.rm = TRUE))

#Regression 
"The regression is going to test whether there is an impact on Google Trends index on median earnings on before and after the college scorecard was launched."
"According to the US department of education, the college scorecard was launched on September 12,2015."

clean_data <- clean_data %>%
  mutate(earning = `md_earn_wne_p10-reported-earnings` >= 64896, post_scorecard = monthorweek >= 
           as.Date("2015-09-12"))

m1 <- feols(index_id ~ earning*post_scorecard, data=clean_data) 
export_summs(m1, digits = 3)

#Visualization 
"The visualization below will show the impacts of Google Trends index within the years of high-earning and low-earning colleges. 
Here, high-earning is depicted as '1', while low-earning is depicted as '0'."
ggplot(bachelors_degree_trend, aes(x=month, y=index_id, color=medianEarning)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color= medianEarning), size=0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2015-09-12")) + theme_bw() + guides(color=guide_legend("Median Earning")) +
  labs(title= "The Impact of Google Trends Index Within the Years for Colleges")

"Interpretation: From the line graph, we can conclude that there is not much difference between the low-earning and high-earning. We can see that both lines 
follow the pattern. In the date that the college scorecard was launched, we can see an increase but a decrease afterwards.
This suggest that median earnings for colleges is not impacted by the google trends."
